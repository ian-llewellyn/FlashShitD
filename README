| Introduction
+---------------+

FlashShitD is a socket policy file server written in C.
This code is a really simple implementation of a socket server with concurrency.

I don't like to write README files, but here, there is a list of URLs about 
why you should/could use an server:

http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player9_security_update.html

I'm using this server in production for a flex chat based on XMPP (ejabberd)
and I can say that this app is really stable (or... it is stable enough for
what I do)

| Alternatives
+--------------+

This URL contains some app written in python and in perl:

http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html

but this code is not considered to be production quality and has not been
tested for secure environments. 

Of course, another alternative is:

  # while :; do cat policy_file.xml | nc -l 843; done

| Init script
+-------------+

I wrote a init script but if you want to use, you must update some variable inside it.
Edit flashShitD.init and change these variables:

  FLASHSHITD=${exec_prefix}/bin/flashShitD
  FLASHSHITCONF=${prefix}/etc/flashShitD.policy
  FLASHSHITPORT=843
  FLASHSHITDUSER=baku
  FLASHSHITPID=/var/run/flashShit.pid

+-
| Dependences
+-------------+

GLib >= 2.16.x - http://www.gtk.org

+-
| Internals
+-----------+

Any client has 10 (-t option) seconds to write the policy request '<policy-file-request />'

+-
| Debug
+-------+

Note: Do not use -d/--debug option!!!
With this feature, flashShitD exits if it receive a "quit" message:

  # ./flashShitD -f /tmp/a.php -P /tmp/flashShit.pid -u baku -g staff -F -d &>/dev/null &
  [1] 54056

  # ps aux | grep 54056
  baku     54056   0.0  0.0  2436876   1948 s001  S     2:13pm   0:00.01 ./flashShitD -f /tmp/a.php -P /tmp/flashShit.pid -u baku -g staff -F -d

  # echo quit | nc localhost 843
  [1]+  Done        ./flashShitD -f /tmp/a.php -P /tmp/flashShit.pid -u baku -g staff -F -d >&/dev/null
